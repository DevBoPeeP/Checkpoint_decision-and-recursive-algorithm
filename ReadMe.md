# Recursion Algorithm

## fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
The formula to calculate the nth Fibonacci number is:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
where:
F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number
F(n-1) is the previous Fibonacci number
F(n-2) is the Fibonacci number before that

## Power Function

The power function calculates the result of a number raised to a certain exponent.

The formula for the power function is:

result = base^exponent
where:
result is the final value
base is the number being multiplied
exponent is the number of times the base is multiplied by itself
